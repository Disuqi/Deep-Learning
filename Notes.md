# Machine learning
Machine learning is turning things (data) into numbers, and finding patterns in those numbers.
In machine learning the computer is the one that finds the patterns with some code and math.
## What
Here is an example
To cook a roast chicken there is input which is all the ingridients, then there are rules and instructions to be followed in a certain order, and from that you get the output which is a cooked roast chicken. This is what a human does. 
Machine learing will take in the input and output, and tell you what the rules and instructions are. 
## Why
Machine learning can be used for complex problems. For example learning how to drive can take a lot of time. If we asked any driver to list all the rules that need to be followed, he would not be able to. Whereas a computer can do that, a computer that knows how to drive, can list all the rules perfectly as they have perfect memory.
## When
Machine learning can be used for anything, as long as you can convert it into numbers and program it to find patterns. But that doesn't mean that you should always use it.
### When not to use it
- When you need explainability.
- When the traditional approach is a better option.
- When errors are unacceptable.
- When you don't have much data.
### When to use it
- problems with long list of rules.
- continually changing enviroments.
- discovering insights within large collections of data.
# Machine learning vs Deep learning
Typically machine learning alogrithms are used on structured data, like tables. A popular algorithm is XGBoost.
Deep learning is typically better for unstructured data. A popular way to do this is by using Neural networks.
## Common algorithms for structured data (machine learning)
- Random forest
- Gradient boosted models
- Naive Bayes
- Nearest neighbour
- Support vector machine
- ...many more
## Common algorithms used for unstructured data (deep learning)
- neural networks
- fully connected neural networks
- convolutional neural network
- recurrent neural network
- transformer
- ...many more
# Neural networks
Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm. They are inspired by the human brain.
Neural networks are composed of layers
There is an input layer, where you pass in the data as numbers.
There is an output layer, where you get the result as numbers.
There are hidden layers, where the magic happens.
# PyTorch
It's the most popular research deep learning framework (in python)
It can run your code on a single or multiple GPUs
It can access prebuilt models
Originally designed and used in house by meta, it is now open source and it is used by Tesla, Microsoft and OpenAI.
# What is a tensor
A tensor can be almost anything, as a tensor is just numbers. When you have some data, whatever that may be for example images, and you turn that into arrays of numbers, you essentially turned that data into a tensor. When you pass that to a neural network and you get the output which is also a bunch of numbers, then that output is also a tensor.
